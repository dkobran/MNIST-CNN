# Example project: How to generate graphs in Gradient

In this example,  we'll build a simple (2-hidden layer) neural network to classify hand written digits using the MNIST dataset and TensorFlow.  

We'll graph the loss and the accuracy as Metrics in our Gradient Job

Here's what a typical output of the detector will look like
